# Prepare an input file outside of the app

If you choose to create the input file outside of the app (versus using
the 'File Builder'), the comma-separated file (CSV) needs to have all
the required fields listed in the tables below depending on the
biological community. Column names must match the spelling, symbology
and capitalization scheme exactly as shown.

There is one more required field (EXCLUDE) that is not shown in the
tables below. That column will be added automatically when you run the
BCG Calculator. The EXCLUDE field marks redundant (non-distinct) taxa,
using the same criteria that were used for BCG development. Redundant
taxa are excluded from richness metric calculations but are included in
the composition (percent individuals) metrics.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you are using the proper Operational Taxonomic Unit
(OTU) and taxa traits/attributes for your metric calculations. The Taxa
Translator and Attribute tables (and associated metadata) that were used
for BCG development can be downloaded
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools_SupportFiles/tree/main/data/taxa_official" target = "_blank">here</a>
. Note, that traits are not required for each record (i.e., trait fields
allow null values).
