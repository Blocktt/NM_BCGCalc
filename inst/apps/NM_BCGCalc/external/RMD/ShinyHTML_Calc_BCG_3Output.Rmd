```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE
                      , results = 'asis'
                      , warning = FALSE

A single zip file will be available for download. It will include all
result files, reference files, and the original input data file. All
result data files will be CSV format, unless otherwise noted.

The zip file will included the base name of the original file along with
the date and time.

The individual files and their contents are output in three subfolders.
Each output file is described in the table below.

```{r}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

# Data
fn_data <- "OutputFileSubtabs.xlsx"
path_data <- file.path("files", fn_data)
df_data <- read_excel(path_data, sheet = "Calc_BCG")

# Display
cap_data <- "Calculation, BCG, zip file contents. 'xxxx' represents either 'bugs' or 'fish' depending on chosen OTU."
knitr::kable(df_data, "html", caption = cap_data)
```
